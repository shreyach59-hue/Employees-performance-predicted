# Employee Performance Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict employee performance based on various features such as work history, skills, attendance, and other relevant data. It helps organizations identify high-performing employees, optimize training efforts, and improve HR decision-making.

The project is designed to run smoothly on **Google Colab**, enabling easy experimentation and scalability without local setup.

## 🎯 How to Run in Google Colab

1. **Open Google Colab:** Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. **Upload the notebook:** Upload the `Employee_Performance_Prediction.ipynb` file from the `notebooks/` folder.

3. **Upload dataset:** Upload your employee dataset CSV file to Colab (or mount Google Drive to access data stored there).

4. **Run cells sequentially:** Execute each cell step-by-step to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train the machine learning models
   - Evaluate performance and visualize results
   - Make predictions on new data

5. **Customize:** Modify parameters or add new features to improve prediction accuracy.
